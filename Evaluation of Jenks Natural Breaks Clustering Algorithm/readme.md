# Evaluation of Jenks Natural Breaks Clustering Algorithm for Changepoint Identification in Streaming Sensor Data

This folder contains the scripts and results created for the paper.           

These scripts are for finding changepoints based on the Maximum Derivative (MD) method using non-overlapping and sliding windows:       
- max_derivative_nonoverlap_5.m      
- max_derivative_nonoverlap_10.m      
- max_derivative_sliding_10.m      

These scripts are for finding changepoints based on the Jenks Natural Breaks (JNB) method using non-overlapping and sliding windows:       
- jnb_nonoverlap_5.m   
- jnb_nonoverlap_10.m      
- jnb_sliding_10.m      

The results of the scripts are stored in MS excel files each titled with name of the method used to create it.      

Summaries of the final results are stored in the following:      
- results_summary_derivative.xlsx (results of MD method)             
- results_summary_jnba.xlsx (results of JNB method)       
- results_summary.xlsx (summary of all results)
