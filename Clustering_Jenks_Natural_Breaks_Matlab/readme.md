# Clustering-via-Jenks-Natural-Breaks-Matlab
Example on using the Jenks Natural Breaks method to cluster a one-dimensional data array into two classes.

Jenks Natural Breaks is a data clustering method. It is an optimization process that finds the best arrangement of values into different classes. It can be used for step-change detection in noisy data. In this example, a one-dimensional array of noisy values is used. The method is applied to the array to find the index of the interface separating the high and low values.
